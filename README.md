# Bot-Practice

This repo contains a simple discord bot, and is mainly used for testing and practice with discord.js

### Usage

To use the discord bot, clone or fork this repository and install the dependencies.  Then run this command on your CLI:
    
    node main.js

### Credits 

I'd like to thank [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) and their guides, as well as the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) documentation, they were a great help.
